# Glitchless Parts

Glitchless Parts is a project that allows you to practice different parts of the full game, instead of IL's. The
idea is that practicing sections instead of the IL is more beneficial to your muscle memory, as it makes you learn how
to go from map to map without just doing full game runs.

The game has been split up into 5 different parts:

```
- Part 1: 00/01 through 04/05
- Part 2: 06/07 through 10
- Part 3: 11/12 through 15
- Part 4: 16    through 18
- Part 5: 19    through e02
```

SiDiouS and I tried to part out the full game by deciding where the game "changes pace" in terms of play style.
It shouldn't be too difficult to use this as a reference to make your own part splits, but I personally like these ones.
